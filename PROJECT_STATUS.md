- ✅ Standalone test script for quick validation (test_standalone.py)
- ✅ Integration test script for validating tool modules (test_integration.py)

### Documentation

- ✅ Enhanced API documentation (README_NEW_API.md)
- ✅ Tool usage examples

## Current Challenges

1. **API Access Issues**: During testing, we encountered 403 Forbidden and 400 Bad
   Request errors, which suggest:
   - The API credentials might need to be updated
   - The OPNsense firewall might have API access restrictions
   - The API endpoints might have changed in the OPNsense version being used

2. **Module Import Structure**: The current Python module structure is causing
   import issues when running the integration tests. This needs to be resolved to
   ensure proper integration.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify API Credentials**: Ensure the API key and secret are set in your `.env`
   file or `~/.opnsense-env` and have the necessary permissions.

2. **Check OPNsense API Version**: Verify the version of OPNsense and ensure the
   API endpoints match those used in the implementation.

3. **Resolve Module Import Issues**: Restructure the module imports to avoid
   circular dependencies.

4. **Complete Integration with MCP Server**: Implement the final integration of
   the enhanced API with the MCP server.

5. **Production Deployment**: Once testing is successful, deploy the enhanced API
   to production.

## Testing the Implementation

To test the standalone API functionality:

```bash
# Test system status
./test_standalone.py system

# Test ARP table
./test_standalone.py arp
```

To run integration tests:

```bash
# Test all components
./test_integration.py

# Test specific component
./test_integration.py --tool system
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter API access issues:

1. Verify that the API credentials in your `.env` file or `~/.opnsense-env` are correct
2. Check that the API access is enabled in OPNsense (System → Settings → Administration)
3. Ensure that the API user has the necessary permissions
4. Check firewall rules that might block API access

For module import issues:

1. Ensure that the Python environment has all required dependencies
2. Check for circular imports in the module structure
3. Consider restructuring problematic imports
